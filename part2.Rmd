#This function will go through each row of the Pseudonym column in the person table and make a vector of each persons rating for all songs that wasn't their own. After that it returns the mean of the vector to get their average.

Person$averageRating<-sapply(Person$pseudonym, 
                             function(name){
  fav<-favorite_rating$Artist_Song[favorite_rating$Pseudonym==name]
  otherSongs<-Ratings$Ratings[Ratings$Artist_Song != fav & Ratings$Pseudonym == name]
  return(mean(otherSongs))
  }
)

#Here I make a simple model that will show all of the other variables in the Person table and their correlation to averageRating to see if they affect it. We want a p-value < 0.5 to determine if they correlate. I also run a function to omit all NAN values from the averageRating column.

Person<-na.omit(Person, cols = "averageRating", invert = FALSE)

simple_model<-lm(Person, formula = averageRating ~ Sex + major + AcademicYear + Birth_Year)
summary(simple_model)

#Here is where I do a sample of 75% for the training model and a sample of 25% for the testing model. If the p-values are < 0.05 then we have a variable with direct correlation to averageRating.

set.seed(385)
Sample<-createDataPartition(Person$averageRating,p = 0.75, list = FALSE)
train<-Person[Sample, ]
test<- Person[-Sample, ]
train_model<-lm(train,formula = averageRating ~ generator_Name + Sex + major + AcademicYear + Birth_Year)
summary(train_model)
test_model<-lm(test,formula = averageRating ~ generator_Name + Sex + major + AcademicYear + Birth_Year)
summary(test_model)
#Since none of the variables have a p-value < 0.05 they aren't significant predictors for the variable averageRating.
